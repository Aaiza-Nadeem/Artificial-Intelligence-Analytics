# Artificial-Intelligence-Analytics
The major problem many artists face is the overwhelming problem that listeners aren’t interested in their songs or don’t like them or their music videos and then the song turns out to be a flop song/album which is a major setback for many artists. By getting the above information about the trending songs/albums then the AI model can make the necessary decision and changes to the songs or albums the artists are set to release to make them fit the trending type of music to make the chances of the song becoming a hit very high hence increasing their popularity exponentially. (E.g.: If an artist is to release a new single, they can alter the tempo and energy of the song to be similar to the hit songs of the current era and hence increase the chances of their songs becoming a hit). This will be done when the AI model learns the solution to questions like ‘Do people like listening to tracks with shorter duration?’ and ‘Are tracks with high loudness more popular?’ etc.
